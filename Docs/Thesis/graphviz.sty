% based on graphviz.tex by Derek Rayside 2003

% add the following lines to your preamble:

% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% \usepackage{graphviz}

% parameters to \digraph:
% 1 - parameters for \includegraphics (optional; default value is "scale=1")
% 2 - name of the digraph
% 3 - body of the digraph

% assumes pdflatex. to modify this command for regular latex,
% replace all .pdf with .ps, and the command becomes simply:
% dot -Tps #2.dot
